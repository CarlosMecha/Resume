    By treating an EEG, data was achieved to detect when the subject thought
    about moving the pointer. The project is still in development.
    \item INSA Project: Developed a PID system in a PIC16F887 for a little moving robot
    (RoboPICA) in MikroC. It was created along with mechanical engineering
    students applying mechatronic concepts.
